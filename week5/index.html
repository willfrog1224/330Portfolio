    <h2>Week 5 Notes</h2> 
    <p>Testing and Debugging</p>
    <p>System error ― a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting</p>
    <p>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo</p>
    <p>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle</p>
    <p>exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
    <p>stack trace - a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred</p> 
    <p>warning can occur if theres an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash</p>
    <p>Linting tools such as JS Lint,JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict mode</p>
    <p> most basic form of debugging is to use the alert() method to show a dialog at certain points in the code</p> 
    <p>Most modern JavaScript environments have a console object that provides a number of methods for logging information and debugging</p>
    <p>modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set breakpoints in your code that will pause it at certain points.</p>
    <p>Remember to remove any references to the debugger command before shipping any code, otherwise the program will appear to freeze when people try to use it!</p> 
    <p>Exception Handling</p>
    <p>try, catch, and finally</p>
    <p>The Jest framework can be used to test your code.</p> 
    <p>consolelog() to show values and variables</p>
    <br>
    <p>Inspect to see the consolelog shown for the JavaScript</p>
