    <h2>Week 9 Notes</h2>
    <p>~9~</p>
    <p>Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</p>
    <p>Global - const, let or var keywords</p>
    <p>Global variables can be accessed in all parts of the program</p>
    <p>three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt()</p>
    <p>window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box</p>
    <p>window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the users browser</p>
    <p>window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page</p>
    <p>protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.). Note that there is a colon (:) at the end</p>
    <p>host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number</p>
    <p>hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL</p>
    <p>port property returns a string describing the port number</p>
    <p>pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain</p>
    <p>window.location object also has the following methods</p>
    <p>reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page</p>
    <p>assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter</p>
    <p>window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on</p>
    <p>colorDepth property can be used to find the color bit depth of the users monitor</p>
    <p>Cookies are session cookies by default. This means they are deleted once a browser session is finished</p>
    <p>window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly executing functions at regular intervals</p>
    <p>window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds</p>
    <p>setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements</p>
    <p>method of the window object works in much the same way as the window.setInterval() method</p>
    <p>window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's 
        built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method</p>
    <p>~14~</p>
    <p>data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser</p>
    <p>Start with data-</p>
    <p>Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or underscores</p>
    <p>Include an optional string value</p>
    <p>data-dropdown could be identified as dropdown menu.</p>
    <p>TML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card</p>
    <p>Web Storage API has some crucial differences with cookies</p>
    <p>Information stored is not shared with the server on every request</p>
    <p>Information is available in multiple windows of the browser (but only if the domain is the same)</p>
    <p>Storage capacity limit is much larger than the 4KB limit for cookies </p>
    <p>Any data stored does not automatically expire as it does with cookies</p>
    <p>key - key of the item that changed</p>
    <p>newValue - new value to which it has been changed</p>
    <p>oldValue - previous value before it was changed</p>
    <p>storageArea - if it is stored in local or session storage</p>
    <p>Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device</p>
    <p>position object passed to the youAreHere() function has a coords property with a latitude and longitude property</p>
    <p>position object has several other properties that can be used to find out information about the location and movement of the device</p>
    <p>clearWatch() method can be used to stop the callback being called</p>
    <p>Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications</p>
    <p>Audio and video clips also have a number of events that will fire when they occur</p>
    <p>canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript</p>
    <p>A shim or polyfill is a piece of code that adds support of missing features to older browsers</p>
