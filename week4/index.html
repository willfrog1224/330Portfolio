    <p>jQuery = most popular JavaScript libraries</p>
    <p>Advantage of libraries is that it is thoroughly tested</p>
    <p>Don't Use More Than One Default Export</p>
    
    <p>Aurelia is a modern framework that uses ES6, and focuses on letting you write dynamic web applications while keeping the implementation details in the background.</p>
    <p>Angular is a powerful framework by Google to make creating dynamic web applications easier. This is done by extending the HTML language using custom ng- attributes.</p>
    <p>Ember is a framework designed to make building large web applications easier. It does this by using common conventions that 
        avoid the need for lots of set-up code, though it can become more difficult if you dont follow these conventions.</p>
    <p>MVC frameworks use templating languages to insert dynamic data into the page.</p>
    <p>Any third-party code installed using npm will be installed into a directory called node_modules. 
        This can be configured to use a different folder name, but for consistency it is best to stick to this convention.</p>
    <p>Modular Organization - This structure groups files by feature rather than type</p>    
    <p>start any project with just the root files: index.html, main.js and main.css.</p>
    <p>The flags used with the webpack command above are quite common when transpiling JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Files can be compressed on the server using the gzip compression tool.</p>
    <p>Minification is the process of removing any redundant characters from the code in order to reduce its file size.</p>
    <p>Webpack can be used to bundle multiple files into a single bundle, and automate common tasks such as transpiling, minifying code and running tests.</p>
    <p>React and Vue.js are popular JavaScript view libraries that render components and keep track of their state.</p>
