    <h2>Week 7 Notes</h2>
    <p>~11~</p> 
    <p>functions can have properties and methods</p>
    <p>Call() - set the value of this</p>
    <p>description property - descibes what it does</p>
    <p>memoization - result caching</p>
    <p>Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE - function that is invoked as soon as it is defined, 
        a useful way to perform tasks but keep the vaiables in the scope fo the function</p>
    <p>No way to remove a variable from a scope once it is declared</p>
    <p>IIFE can be used to set up any initialization code that there will be no need for again</p>
    <p>IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it does not affect the other parts of the program</p>
    <p>recursive function - invokes itself until a certain condition is met</p>
    <p>Callbacks can be used to facilitate event-driven asynchronous programming</p>
    <p>Callback hell is the term used to refer to this tangled mess of code</p>
    <p>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation</p>
    <p>Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.</p>
    <p>Rejected ― the asynchronous operation did not work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.</p>
    <p>Once a promise has been settled, the then() method can be used to deal with the outcome</p>
    <p>Promises come into their own when multiple asynchronous tasks are required to be carried out one after the other.</p>
    <p>Async functions were added to the ES2017 specification.</p>
    <p>Callbacks can be used to build more generalized functions</p>
    <p>functions can accept another function as an argument (a callback), but they can also return a function</p>
    <p>closure is formed when the inner function is returned by the outer function, maintaining access to any variables declared inside the enclosing function</p>
    <p>closure is formed when a function returns another function that then maintains access to any variables created in the original function scope</p>
    <p>A pure function is a function that adheres to the following rules:</p>
    <p>1) return value only depends on provided arguments</p>
    <p>2) no side-effects</p>
    <p>3) referential transparency</p>
    <p>pure function must have:</p>
    <p>At least one argument</p>
    <p>A return value</p>
    <p>Higher-order functions are functions that accept another function as an argument, or return another function as a result, or both</p>
    <p>Currying - involves the partial application of functions, when not all arguments have been supplied to the function, so it returns another function 
        that retains the arguments already provided, and expects the remaining arguments that were omitted when the original function was called</p>
    <p>~13~</p>
    <p>Ajax - a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading</p>
    <p>Web pages were no longer static, but dynamic applications</p>
    <p>web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers</p>
    <p>Asynchronous - can run while data is sent back and forth</p>
    <p>Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated in real time.</p>
    <p>Fetch API introduced the Response interface that deals with the object that is returned when the promise is fulfilled</p>
    <p>redirect() method can be used to redirect to another URL</p>
    <p>text() method takes a stream of text from the response, reads it to completion and then returns a promise that resolves to 
        a USVSting object that can be treated as a string in JavaScript</p>
    <p>blob() method - used to read a file of raw data, such as an image or a spreadsheet</p>
    <p>JSON is probably the most common format for AJAX responses</p>
    <p>json() method is used to deal with these by transforming a stream of JSON data into a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object.</p>
    <p>five most commonly used verbs when dealing with the web are:</p>
    <p>GET requests to retrieve resources</p>
    <p>POST requests, usually used to create a resource but can actually perform any task</p>
    <p>PUT requests to upsert, which means insert a resource or update it entirely</p>
    <p>PATCH requests to make partial updates to a resource</p>
    <p>DELETE requests to delete a resources.</p>
    <p>HTTP headers are used to pass on any additional information about a request or response</p>
    <p>We can also use Ajax to send information</p>
    <p>Fetch API includes the FormData interface, which makes it much easier to submit information in forms using Ajax</p>
