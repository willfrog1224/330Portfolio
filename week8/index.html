    <h2>Week 7 Notes</h2>
    <p>~8~</p>
    <p> CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page</p>
    <p>translate(x,y) function moves an element x from the left, and y from the top</p>
    <p>along the x axis - transform: translateX(45px);</p>
    <p>along the y axis - transform: translateY(-30px);</p>
    <p>Transforms dont work on inline elements</p>
    <p>scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically</p>
    <p> translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions</p>
    <p>rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value</p>
    <p>skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes</p>
    <p>steps to create a simple transition using only CSS</p>
    <p>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration</p>
    <p>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state</p>
    <p>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties</p>
    <p>transition-property property defines the CSS properties of the element that should be transitioned, with all for all properties being the default</p>
    <p>exception to this “if there is a valid midpoint, it can be transitioned” rule is visibility</p>
    <p>transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state</p>
    <p>transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail</p>
    <p>transition-delay - introduce a delay before the transition begins</p>
    <p>transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call</p>
    <p>Animations - allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes</p>
    <p>To animate an element in CSS, you first create a named animation, then attach it to an element in that elements property declaration block</p>
    <p>animation-iteration-count property lets you define how many times the animation will play through</p>
    <p>animation iterates, it normally goes from the 0% to the 100% keyframe</p>
    <p>~12~</p>
    <p>HTML5s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript</p>
    <p> first step to using canvas is to add a canvas element to the pag</p>
    <p>text in between the canvas tags will only be shown if the canvas element is not supported by the visitor’s browser</p>
    <p>canvas element takes both a width and height attribute, which must also be set</p>
    <p>fillStyle, we could have used a CanvasGradient or a CanvasPattern object</p>
    <p>reate a CanvasGradient object to use as our fillStyle</p>
    <p>not limited to drawing rectangles—we can draw any shape we can imagine</p>
    <p>Paths create a blueprint for your lines, arcs, and shapes, but paths are invisible until you give them a stroke</p>
    <p>Radians are a unit used to measure angles, and the symbol π denotes a measurement in radians</p>
    <p>radian is equal to 180 degrees</p>
    <p>Redrawing an image element from the page onto a canvas is fairly unexciting</p>
    <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML</p>
    <p>Much as with canvas, you can draw images into a container that you create using Raphaël</p>
    <p>Canvas allows for pixel manipulation, as we saw when we turned our video from color to black and white</p>
    <p>what you draw to SVG is accessible via the DOM, because its mode is retained mode, meaning that the structure of the image is preserved in the XML document that describes it</p>
    <p>Note that draggable is not a Boolean attribute, so you have to explicitly set it to true</p>
    <p>DataTransfer objects are one type of object outlined in the Drag and Drop API</p>
    <p>DataTransfer lets us define two pieces of information</p>
    <p>the type of data we’re saving of the draggable element</p>
    <p>the value of the data itself</p>
    <p>The element below is draggable</p>
    <p id="p1" draggable="true">Pull me around</p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
